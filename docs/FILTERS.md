  
  If you see a filter for eagle, crown, or anchor, it's based on the description of the coat of arms scraped from Wikipedia.
  
  For the **'apple'** filter, we can use phrases like **'apple', 'apples'** and if the description contains one of those words, the coat of arms will be marked accordingly.
  
  This method isn't ideal (for example, sometimes the text describes a previous version of the coat of arms). The 'excludes' and 'includes' options allow us to manually remove or add specific coat of arms.
