### This area is under construction (I'm trying to find the best startegy)

If you see a filter for eagle, crown, or anchor, it's based on the description of the coat of arms scraped from Wikipedia.

For to create **'apple'** filter, we can use phrases like **apple, apples** and if the description contains one of those words, the coat of arms will be marked accordingly.

This method isn't ideal (for example, sometimes the text describes a previous version of the coat of arms). The 'exclude' and 'include' options allow us to manually remove or add specific coat of arms.

### How to Create a Lion Filter

#### Creation of Basic Filter

1. Create a basic filter named "lion" with the phrases: "lion, lions, leo, lioness". These should work well.
2. Activate the "Show only those with text" mode and check the CoA (Coat of Arms) with descriptions to determine which words are missing from the step above it can be "lionhead" for a few.

 A basic filter based on search is refined.

##### Tips:
Do you speak Finnish? I don't. 

1. I copy the description (that's why those copy buttons are near them).
2. Go to chatgpt and ask: Which word in this text is the name of an animal? [copied text]
3. In response I will get "The word "leijona" in the text is the name of an animal. It translates to "lion" in English."

I often ask about other forms of words, and ChatGPT is very helpful in quickly identifying the key ones.

#### Excluding False Positives

1. Activate filter and from wisible CoA exclude lUse the filter to exclude CoA that doesn't have a lion.

The filter should only include lions.

#### Including Missing Items

1. Got to custom filter settings and reverse it.

You will see only CoA without animals.

1. Find coats of arms without lions and include them.

The filter has optimal search matching by phrases, excludes false positives, and includes CoA without descriptions.

##### Draft of better process - WiP   
For example, by selecting "lion" as a custom filter and reversing it, we get all CoA that do not match it.

Then, we can enable the "without animals" filter, which isn't custom.

This will match all CoA without animals and apply additional filtering based on the reversed lion filter.

This is essentially how the filters are created. For more details, refer to FILTERS.md.
